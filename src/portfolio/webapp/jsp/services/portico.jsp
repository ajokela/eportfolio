	<h3>What is the Portico&trade;?</h3>
	<div class="indent">
	<p>Portico&trade; is an application you download to your computer.
	It allows you to upload multiple files at a time to your ePortfolio.
	Using the desktop application, you may select files from your computer
	you'd like to add to ePortfolio. You don't even need to be logged on to
	start collecting files in the Portico&trade; to add to ePortfolio! To
	upload the files from Portico&trade;, you simply log in and send them
	to your ePortfolio. They are automatically added to your Materials in
	the "Portico&trade; Uploaded" folder where they can then be attached to
	elements, tagged, and moved into any other Material folder, just like
	any other ePortfolio material.</p>
	<p>This is what the Portico&trade; looks like: <br />

	<h3>Download Portico&trade;</h3>
	<br />
	<h3>Important Note: The Portico&trade; is not meant to be used on
	publicly shared computers. Its intended use is for your personal
	computer only. By downloading and installing the Portico&trade;, you
	acknowledge this.</h3>
	<br />
	<h3>Step 1: Download Java Runtime Environment (PC and Linux users
	only):</h3>
	<div class="indent">
	<p>Mac users can skip this step and proceed to Step 2 (the Java
	Runtime Environment is included with all Macs running OS X). <br />
	<br />
	PC users should download the Java Runtime Environment if they haven't
	already done so. PC users will only need to do this step one time.
	After the Java Runtime Environment has been installed on your computer,
	you do not need to do it again. <br />
	<br />
	Note: If you have trouble with these instructions or the installation,
	please email <a href="mailto:portfolio@umn.edu">portfolio@umn.edu</a>
	for help. <br>
	<br>
	A. Open this link (it should open in a new page so that you can
	continue to read these instructions): <br />
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.html" target="_blank">Download
	Java Runtime Environment</a> <br />
	<br />
	B. On the 'Java Runtime Environment' page, under "Required: You must
	accept the license agreement to download the product:"<br />
	Click the radio button next to "Accept License Agreement ." <br />
	<br />
	C. Most PC users are running a Windows platform. If you are running
	something other than Windows (such as Linux), you will probably know.
	If you are not sure of your platform, assume you are running Windows.<br />
	Windows users should choose "Windows Online Installation" under the
	Windows platform heading. Linux users should choose the appropriate
	link under the Linux heading. <br />
	<br />
	D. You will be prompted about whether or not you would like to run the
	file or save the file to your computer (depending on your computer you
	may have both options, or just the save option). Click "run" if the
	option is available. Otherwise agree to save the file (click the "Save"
	button), and then open the file you have saved. <br />
	<br />
	If you are able, open the file directly from the download prompt, or
	you can open it from the desktop. It will have an icon that looks like
	this: <br />
	<br />

	<br />
	E. Double-click the icon to run the installation program if it has not
	already begun running. <br />
	<br />
	F. You will be prompted to accept the license agreement with "Typical
	Setup" selected. Click the "Accept" button to continue the
	installation. <br />
	<br />
	G. The program will begin installing and take a few minutes to download
	installation files. <br />
	<br />
	H. When the program is finished installing, a "Finish" button will
	appear. Click the button to complete the installation and continue to
	Step 2. <br />
	<br />
	</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Step 2:</h3>
	<div class="indent">
	<p>Download and install the ePortfolio Portico&trade;using the link
	below. <br />
	<br />
	During the installation you will be asked to approve a certificate.
	This application requires special access rights that allow it to read
	and write files, as well as access the ePortfolio application through
	the Internet. Select "Yes" to allow the application to grant the access
	rights to the application. <br />
