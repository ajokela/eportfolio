		Portfolios be shared with non-OSPI users?</span><br />
		Yes, Portfolio folders may be shared with current OSPI users as well
		as individuals outside of the OSPI Community to whom you grant
		access.&nbsp;&nbsp;When creating a folder enter the email address of
		the individual(s) in the <span class="textBold">Email Address
		(Non - OSPI)</span> field.<br />
		<br />
		<span class="BodyStyleBold">Can individuals given viewing
		privileges to a folder see ALL of the information in my Portfolio?<br />
		</span>No, you can choose to share any or all of the information you have in
		your Portfolio with any individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;The individuals you
		have chosen to share information with will only see the information
		you have chosen to share with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
		<br />
		<span class="BodyStyleBold">How will individuals [given viewing
		privileges] know that I have shared a folder with them?</span><br />
		We have added a new feature to Portfolio, now when you create a new
		folder to share, an email message will be generated for ALL of the
		individuals with whom you chose to share the
		information.&nbsp;&nbsp;The email message will provide the individual
		with directions on where to access and how to login to Portfolio.<br />
		<br />
		<span class="BodyStyleBold">How will Non - OSPI individuals
		access folders to which they have been given viewing privileges?</span><br />
		A unique password will be generated for each Non - OSPI user with whom
		you chose to share a Portfolio folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;The email message
		will provide the individual with directions on where to access and how
		to login to Portfolio using his or her email address and password. <br />
		<br />
		<span class="BodyStyleBold">How secure is Portfolio?</span><br />
		An advantage of Portfolio is the high level of security. The secure
		server uses SSL (secure socket layer); this ensures that all of your
		Portfolio information is encrypted and cannot be read as the
		information travels over the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more details
		about security, read the <a href="privacyStatement.jsp" tabindex="1">Privacy
		Statement</a>. <span class="BodyStyleBold"><br />
